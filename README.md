# Angular-Socket.IO
Using Socket.IO with Angular

NOTE: Socket.IO will not work unless you start the server first.

Start the server first using:
```
npm run server
```
And then run: 
```
npm start
```
The main page will have buttons at the top of the page for navigation, on each page, view the browser's inspect console to see the data being recieved from Socket.IO from the server.
